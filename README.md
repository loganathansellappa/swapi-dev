Build a 'wiki' on characters, planets, and star ships using The Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) in a SPA with a favourites list feature.
We'd like you to use React with some state management library of your choice (whatever you're most comfortable with).
The design and structure are completely up to you. Feel free to use a CSS framework too, the fancier you can make it look the better, however, we
don't expect it to be an award-winning design just something that considers your ideas on usability.
Each character should have a 'Favourite' button which allows the user to save this character as a favourite. Displaying these favourites somehow
and the ability to remove them again from the list (and from the
character page) should be implemented but is up to you on how and
where this is displayed. Storing this data in memory (via some state management) or local
storage is fine. It only needs to persist for the current session.
